# ðŸš€ Zig Learning Journey

Welcome to my **Zig programming language** learning repository!  
This repo contains notes, code samples, and experiments as I explore **Zigâ€™s syntax, type system, memory model, and compile-time power**.

## ðŸ§  About Zig

[Zig](https://ziglang.org/) is a low-level, general-purpose programming language designed for:
- **Performance and safety without hidden control flow**
- **Manual memory management with modern syntax**
- **Compile-time metaprogramming**
- **C interoperability** and cross-compilation built in

Zig replaces the need for macros or reflection by giving developers **full control at compile time**.
