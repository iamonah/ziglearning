//blocks are expression and they are labeled this is a label  outer_block:

//In Zig, { ... } by itself defines a block expression â€” a sequence of statements that produces a value (the value of its last expression).


// | Syntax      | Meaning                                         |
// | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
// | `struct {}` | Defines a **struct type** with no fields        |
// | `.{}`       | Constructs a **tuple literal** (possibly empty) |
// | `{}`        | A **block expression**, not a data type         |


// block is used to limit a scope of variables

// variables inside a block cannot have same names as variables outside a block

// defined by curly brackets


// to return a value in block the blocks must be labelled and the break key word is used inside the block
