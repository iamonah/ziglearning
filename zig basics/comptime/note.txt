-comptime(compile time) what happens during compilation
-runtime is what happens during program execution

compile konw expressions are used to optimize the code during execution

example of compile values
1. harcoded values
2. results of expressions with comptime values

comptime keyword can be used with:

1. Variables: The variable exists only at compile time and can be modified during compilation.

2. Function parameters: The argument must be known at compile time when calling the function.

3. Expressions: The expression and all its values are evaluated at compile time.

4. (Bonus) Blocks: Code inside runs during compilation (e.g., comptime { ... }).


comptime means “the compiler executes this before your program even runs.”
It’s great for precomputing, code generation, or creating optimized constants.

If something is known at comptime,
it means the compiler already knows it and may precompute it,
but your runtime program can still use the result —
the runtime just doesn’t “redo” the work.
